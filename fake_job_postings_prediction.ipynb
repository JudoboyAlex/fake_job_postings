    "\n",
    "I was interested in fake job postings after witnessing numerous cases where software developers got scammed out of fake job postings during tech layoffs period. I figured this could be good opportunity for me to learn how to identify fake job postings using NLP which is the deep learning model that I learnt in week 4.  \n",
    "The dataset contains 18K job descriptions out of which about 800 are fake. The data consists of both textual information and meta-information about the jobs. The dataset can be used to create classification models which can learn the job descriptions which are fraudulent. The goal is to use NLP to identify key traits/features (words, entities, phrases) of job descriptions which are fraudulent in nature.\n",
